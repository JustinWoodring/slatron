## Why Slatron?

Slatron isn't just a media player; it's a complete broadcasting suite designed for creators who want to build something unique. Whether you're running a community TV channel, a retro radio station, or dynamic digital signage, Slatron provides the tools to make it feel alive.

### Autonomous AI Hosts
Our AI DJs don't just play tracks; they understand context. Using advanced LLMs, they can introduce songs, comment on the weather, or engage in station-wide banter, providing a professional broadcast feel without the need for a 24/7 staff.

### Hackable & Extensible
Built with Rust and Rhai scripting, Slatron is designed to be modified. Write custom scripts to automate your station, integrate with external APIs, or create complex playback logic.

### Professional Branding
With our MLT-based bumper system, your station will look as good as it sounds. Dynamic overlays, lower thirds, and transitions are rendered on-the-fly, ensuring your branding is always consistent and professional.
